HTTP service that allows users to upload datasets directly to a site,
skipping Galaxy entirely.

== Adding a New Handler

New handlers can be added to the udis stack by editing the
https://github.com/VEuPathDB/service-user-dataset-import/blob/master/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose.yml]
file and the
https://github.com/VEuPathDB/service-user-dataset-import/blob/master/config.json[config.json]
file with the new handler configuration.

The `docker-compose.yml` file puts the new image on the internal docker network
so the import service can access it, and the `config.json` file tells the import
service how to access it.

=== Prerequisites

Before a new handler can be added, it must first be registered in Jenkins and
have a built image published to the https://hub.docker.com/u/veupathdb[VEuPathDB Dockerhub].

For more on implementing a handler, see this https://github.com/VEuPathDB/example-dataset-import-handler[import handler template].

=== `docker-compose.yml`

To add the new handler to the docker-compose file, copy/paste one of the
existing handler entries and edit it to suit your new handler.

.Original Config
[source, yml]
----
  biom-handler: <1>
    image: veupathdb/user-dataset-handler-biom:${BIOME_HANDLER_TAG:-latest} <2>
    networks:
      - internal
      - monitoring-ext
    labels:
      - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=${BIOME_HANDLER_WATCHTOWER:-false}" <3>
      - "traefik.enable=false"
      - "prometheus-scrape.enabled=true"
----
<1> The internal network name of the handler.  This value must be unique and contain only URL safe characters.
<2> The docker image name and version env-var
<3> The watchtower name and version-env-var

To create a new handler in the stack, edit your copy like so:

[source, yml]

    networks:

      - monitoring-ext
    labels:
      - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=${BIOME_HANDLER_WATCHTOWER:-false}"
      - "traefik.enable=false"
      - "prometheus-scrape.enabled=true"

  my-new-handler: <1>
    image: veupathdb/user-dataset-handler-my-new-handler:${MY_NEW_HANDLER_TAG:-latest} <2>
    networks:
      - internal
      - monitoring-ext
    labels:
      - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=${MY_NEW_HANDLER_WATCHTOWER:-false}" <3>
      - "traefik.enable=false"
      - "prometheus-scrape.enabled=true"
----
<1> New handler network name
<2> Updated docker-image name and version env-var.
<3> Updated watchtower env-var.

After this change is made and committed, Ops will need to be notified of the
change so they can update the deployment configuration on their end.


=== `config.json`

Similar to the docker-compose file, the easiest way to add a new service
configuration is to copy an existing one and append it to the `services` array.

.Original Config
[source, json]
----
{
  "services": [
    {
      "dsType": "biom", <1>
      "projects": [
        "MicrobiomeDB" <2>
      ],
      "fileTypes": [
        "biom" <3>
      ],
      "name": "biom-handler" <4>
    }
  ]
}
----
<1> Value that will be sent by the client to select your handler for use with
    the upload.
<2> List of projects your handler is allowed to be used from.
<3> File types/extensions allowed to be handled by your handler.  In addition to
    the file types listed here, zip and tar files are also permitted by default.
<4> The network name for your handler as configured in the `docker-compose.yml`
    file.

  "services": [
    {
      "dsType": "biom",

      ],
      "fileTypes": [
        "biom"
      ],
      "name": "biom-handler"
    },
    {
      "dsType": "mine",
      "projects": [
        "PlasmoDB",
        "FungiDB"
      ],
      "fileTypes": [

the RAML code generation creating incorrect controller methods for handling

=== Running Locally

==== Prerequisites

To bring up the eda project via docker-compose, youâ€™ll need a few things.

* a functioning docker setup and docker-compose (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

* a functioning traefik setup. clone the https://github.com/VEuPathDB/docker-traefik[VEuPathDB docker traefik repo], and run docker-compose up -d in the clone, or follow the instructions in that repo. This will run traefik locally, which handles the container routing.

Once the service is brought up using `docker-compose`, the endpoints can be accessed at the host name specified in the `TRAEFIK_HOST` environment variable (default configuration is https://udis-dev.local.apidb.org:8443).

==== SSH Forwarding
There are

==== Local Overrides
In order to run the service, overriding the latest images with your locally built changes, you can make use of the `docker-compose-build-*.yml` files. If you are testing updates to an individual handler, you can include the relevant `docker-compose-build-*.yml` file in addition to the main `docker-compose.yml` file when running docker-compose:

[source, shell script]
----
docker-compose -f docker-compose-build-gene-list.yml -f docker-compose.yml
